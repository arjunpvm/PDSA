# ----- MERGE SORT -----
***
both selection and insertion sort take time O(n<sup>2</sup>)

this is feasible for n < 10000

new strategy:
* Divide the list into two halves
* separately sort left and right half

combine two sorted lists A and B to C
* compare first elements of A and B
* move the smaller of them to C
* repeat until A and B are empty
*** 
let n be the length of L

sort A[: n // 2]

sort A[n // 2 :]

then merge them into B

we sort A[: n // 2], A[n // 2 :]  recursively the same as insertion sort
***
### merging sorted lists
***
combine  two sorted lists A and B to C
* if A is empty then append B to C
* if B is empty then append A to C
* else compare A and B 
	* move smaller element to C
* repeat till A and B are empty

```python
def merge(A, B):
	(m, n) = (len(A), len(B))
	(C, i, j, k) = ([], 0, 0, 0)
	while k < (m+n):
		if i == m:
			C.extends(B[j:])
			k = k + n - j 
		elif j == n:
			C.extends(A[i:])
			k = k + m - i 
		elif A[i] < B[j]:
			C.append(A[i])
			(k,i) = (k+1, i+1)	
		elif B[j] < A[i];
			C.append(B[j])
			(k,j) = (k+1, j+1)	
	return C
```

here i and j are the no of sorted elements and k is the no of elements added to C


```python
def merge_sort(A):
	n = len(A)
	if n <= 1:
		return A
	L = merge_sort(A[:n//2])
	R = merge_sort(A[n//2:])
	B = merge(L, R)
	return B
```
