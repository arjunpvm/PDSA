# ----- ANALYSIS OF MERGE SORT -----
***
### Analysis of merge function
* A has m elements and B has n elements
*  C  will have m+n elements
*  for each loop we add at least one element to C
*  So the no of loops taken in worst case is m + n loops
* Hence merge is O(m + n)
* we know that m + n <= 2(max(m, n))
* here m â‰ˆ n so O(m + n) will become O(2n)
* hence merge is O(n)
### Analysis of merge_sort
* let A has n elements and n = 2<sup>k</sup>
* T(0) = T(1) = 1
* T(n) = 2 T(n/2) + n (since it has 2 merge_sort  and one merge sort whose T(n) is n
* unwinding the recursion:
	* T(n) = 2 (2 T(n/4) + n /2) + n = 2<sup>2</sup>  T(n/2<sup>2</sup> )+ 2 n
	* T(n) = 2<sup>k</sup> T(n/2<sup>k</sup>)  + kn
	*  when  k = log n, 2<sup>k</sup>  = n
	* when k = log n
	* T(n)  =  n(1) + (log n)  n
	* T(n)  =  n +n  (log n)  
	since n log n is bigger than n 
*  T(n) is O(n log n)
