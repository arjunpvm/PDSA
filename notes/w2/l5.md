# ----- SELECTION SORT -----


#### sorting makes many things easier
* Binary search
* finding median 
* checking for duplicates
* building frequency tables
#### selection sort
* select the next element in sorted order
* append it to the final result
* avoid using a second list
	* put the minimum element in the first place and put the first element in the place of the minimum element
	* put second element in the second place and so on
*  eventually the list will be sorted in ascending order

***
```python
def selection_sort(l):
	n = len(l)
	if l <= 1:
		return l
	
	for i in range(n):
		min = i
		for j in range(i+1, n): # this loop checks for most minimum number in the list after i
			if l[j] < l[min]:
				min = j # min is the position of minimum in l[i:]
		(l[i], l[min]) = (l[min], l[i]) # here we swap the n'th minimum number with the n'th number

	return l

```  

while writing an algorithm make sure it does the job correctly
#### Efficiency
* outer for loop takes n iterations
* inner for loop takes n-i iterations
* T(n) = n + n-1 + ... + 1
* T(n) = n(n+1) / 2
* T(n) is O(n<sup></sup>)
