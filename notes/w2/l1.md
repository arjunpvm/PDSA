# ----- ANALYSIS OF ALGORITHMS -----

# running time of an algorithm depends on the input size

# so we measure the time as a function of input size

# if input size is n then t(n)

# also different inputs of same size may take different amount of time

"""
    when comparing t(n):
        ignore constant factors
            let f(n) = n**3 and g(n) = 5000 * n**2
            here f(n) overtakes g(n) for larger values of n
            so we ignore the constant 5000
